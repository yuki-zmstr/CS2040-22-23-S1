height of the tree is the same

every level same amt of work (just multiply them) vs 

every level is diff amt of work (sum them up)

outer loop multiply inner loop (j independant of i) vs 



j dependant on i (sum of j) (outer control number of times inner is executed)

i = 1 2 4 8 . . . 2^lgn
j = 1 2 4 8 . . . 2^lgn

s = 0
for(i=1; i<= 2n;i=i*2)
for(




tightness -> req n^2  so n^3 not allowed

O(lg(n!))=O(lg(n)(n-1)(n-2)....)
lgn^n = nlgn 

if the increment or decrement is multiplying or dividing respectively 
-> reach condition faster
-> time take is shorter
-> O() will be smaller, usually lower than n (eg. lgn)

if u do redirection, DONT USE MORE THAN 1 SCANNER OBJECT IN THE CODE!!!

put the Scanner as a param for the method,
or just declare within the method itself directly (refer to 18.8.22 Scanner mistakes jpg)

BufferReader is faster than Scanner

is it better to put all input and output files in one folder without sub-folders?

public static vs public void

u must be within the directory WITH the file to move the file!

How to mve multiple files at once to another dir?
